I Recommend starting in src/scenes/game.js, edit the menu screen, and win screen after you complete your game.

## What we're trying to achieve

This starter template is meant to be a kickoff spot for a full-fledged PhaserJS game project.

- Simple template with asset pipeline to help you get started
- Ability to pivot into turn based games, action games, or any other kind of game.
- Good example code for various common game UX patterns.
- Livereload dev server using Parcel Bundler
- Support for `html`, `pug`, `md`, `js`, `jsx`, `ts`, `tsx`, `json`, `css`, `scss`, `postcss`, `less`, and various
  image filetypes, font files, and more. (See [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel)'s documentation)
- Yarn for faster package resolution
